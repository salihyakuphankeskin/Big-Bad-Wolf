    <h1>Energy system</h1>

    <p>
        An energy system is a system primarily designed to supply energy-services to end-users.[1]: 941  The intent behind energy systems is to minimise energy losses to a negligible level, as well as to ensure the efficient use of energy.[2] The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report defines an energy system as "all components related to the production, conversion, delivery, and use of energy".

    <h2>Treatment</h2>
    <p>
        From a structural perspective, an energy system is like any system and is made up of a set of interacting component parts, located within an environment.[8] These components derive from ideas found in engineering and economics. Taking a process view, an energy system "consists of an integrated set of technical and economic activities operating within a complex societal framework".[5]: 423  The identification of the components and behaviors of an energy system depends on the circumstances, the purpose of the analysis, and the questions under investigation. The concept of an energy system is therefore an abstraction which usually precedes some form of computer-based investigation, such as the construction and use of a suitable energy model.[9]

    <h3>Economic modeling</h3>
    <p>
        Conversely, relatively pure economic modeling may adopt a sectoral approach with only limited engineering detail present. The sector and sub-sector categories published by the International Energy Agency are often used as a basis for this analysis. A 2009 study of the UK residential energy sector contrasts the use of the technology-rich Markal model with several UK sectoral housing stock models.[11]
