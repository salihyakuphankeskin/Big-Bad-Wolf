    <h2>Marchwood</h2>
    <h4>Marchwood is a village and civil parish located in Hampshire, England, United Kingdom. It lies between Totton and Hythe on the western shore of Southampton Water and directly east of the New Forest. The population of the village in the 2011 census was 6,141.[1]</h4>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <h4>
        <p>
            Marchwood has seen human activity since Roman times. The Roman road from the Calshot/Lepe area passed through here on its way to Nursling (Onna as it was called).[3] Roman coins have been found at Bury Farm.[3]
        </p>
        <p>
            The name "Marchwood" is most probably from the Old English "merecewudu" meaning "smallage wood" ("smallage" is a term for wild celery).[4] It is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as "Merceode", when the manor was held by Alwin, whose father Wulfgeat held the manor before 1066.[5]
